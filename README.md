# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ML
A machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using historical customer behavior data. The project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and multiple ML models to identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights for businesses to improve customer retention.

**Key Highlights**

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, creating new features (e.g., ChargeRatio, TotalServices)
Model Development: Implemented and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Means clustering
Performance Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Results: Logistic Regression achieved the best balance (Accuracy ~78.7%, F1 ~0.56, ROC-AUC ~0.83) and was selected as the final model
Insights: Features like contract type, tenure, payment method, and internet service play a critical role in predicting churn


**Tech Stack**

Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: EDA, Feature Engineering, Classification Models, Clustering, Model Evaluation

**Purpose**
The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can empower businesses to identify at-risk customers and proactively reduce churn, enhancing customer loyalty and profitability.
